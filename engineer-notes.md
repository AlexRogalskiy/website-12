- RobertTables: I like to do this

# First Steps

1. Install Projects
   - Fork the website, run `npm i` within the root folder and run `npm run d`. This will run a Gatsby server at port `8000`.

## NOTE

You can also open a collab session with someone who has the fork already installed, and access their local server apart from viewing their terminal and code.

# To-DO

- [x] Create new page not included in the folder "[pages](./src/pages)".
- [ ] Create branded header component.
  - If header component is disactivated or void, then ignore.
