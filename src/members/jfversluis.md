Hi! I'm a software engineer at Microsoft on the Xamarin.Forms team. With my live streaming I hope to engage with our users and learn from them. Hopefully they will also learn something from me in return. Subjects might differ from time to time or even per stream, but will usually involve building apps in some way. This might include, but is not limited to: working on a Xamarin.Forms issue, building an app or exploring some new concept or feature.

In also [blog](https://blog.verslu.is) (somewhat) regularly about current topics.

_My stream is not the property of my employer. Opinions are my own and in no way reflect anything from Microsoft._
