Hi everyone! I'm a software engineer on the [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) team at Microsoft. In addition to PowerShell itself, I work on the Visual Studio Code extension for PowerShell, helped ship the PowerShell experience in Azure Functions, work on the PowerShell Jupyter kernel and more! I'm a developer experience nut, love coffee and love to customize mechanical keyboards.

I use C#, TypeScript, and of course, PowerShell, every day.

See what I'm up to both at work and off work on my [GitHub](https://github.com/TylerLeonhardt) üêôüêà
