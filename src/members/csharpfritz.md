Jeffrey T. Fritz – or simply “Fritz” is a Program Manager for Microsoft on the ASP.NET and .NET Community Outreach teams.

During the day, and on my stream, I write .NET code for websites and applications. I hope you join me to learn more about .NET, .NET Core, and Visual Studio.

My stream is not the property of my employer, even though I may bring some colleagues on to talk about their projects.

I have written a [blog post about my live-streaming configuration](https://jeffreyfritz.com/2019/01/live-streaming-setup-2019-edition) if you are interested in learning how I built the stream
