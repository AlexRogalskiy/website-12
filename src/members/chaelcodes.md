Hello! I'm ChaelCodes. I've been a professional developer for 7+ years and I've been a professional Rails Developer for 3+ years. I like to live-code and play programming-adjacent games on Twitch. I stick to my schedule, but if there are any updates, this [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=lvrm9vudiiloam5ke095qt5np8%40group.calendar.google.com) is always up to date. My chat loves our cat snuggle time, Shenzhen I/O solitaire, the upbeat positive vibes, and ZoomIt!
