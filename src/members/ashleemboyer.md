I'm a Fullstack Web Developer and avid knitter in Indiana. I've been knitting since 2018 and writing code since 2014. Back then, I was studying Chemical Engineering but found I enjoyed coding a lot more and switched to major in Software Engineering. My education was based in Java but [I've done a lot of things](https://twitter.com/ashleemboyer/status/1229081000887619584)&mdash;Python, C, x86 Assembly, PHP, and more! I never would have guessed I'd be a Professional Web Developer and Public Speaker 6 years later.

I mostly speak on the importance of Web Accessibility from my perspective as a Disabled developer and have recently gotten into speaking more on the technical side of accessibility. I'll be streaming about building accessible React components for most of 2020! You can read about the series [on my blog site](https://ashleemboyer.com/build-an-accessible-react-component-the-live-series).

Speaking of, I love writing too! I started blogging regularly in April of 2019 [on the DEV Community site](https://dev.to/ashleemboyer) with a 30-day blogging challenge and I was hooked. Being open and vulnerable about learning, work and mental health, and being a Disabled developer has introduced to me to incredible people in the tech community and all it has to offer.

My favorite thing about being a part of the community is having the ability to pass along what I've learned over the years and helping break down barriers for others who, like me, haven't seen representation in the tech industry.
