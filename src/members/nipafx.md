Nicolai (aka nipafx) is a Java enthusiast with a passion for learning and sharing.
He does that in blog posts, articles, newsletters, and books; in tweets, repos, videos, and streams; at conferences and in-house trainings - more on all of that on [codefx.org](https://codefx.org).
That aside, he's best known for his haircut.
