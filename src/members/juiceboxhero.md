Hello, I am juiceboxhero! I am coding streamer and Twitch staffer. I am currently a Senior Product Manager Technical working on user privacy and data egression. Recently, I've begun teaching myself programming on stream, and I use my channel as a platform for raising money and awareness for incredible causes and charitable organizations.

### All of the money I make on my stream goes directly to a charity that I pick every other month. Including bits, subs, and donations.

I love working for Twitch and the communities it creates. The part of Twitch I am most proud of is the culture of giving back to worthy causes. I want to do my part to encourage people to use Twitch as a powerful tool creating communities who can do incredible things together. I am passionate about humanitarian and climate change charity. I have had a lifetime commitment to charity and volunteer work, led the YAC of the East Bay for four years, volunteer at the First Lego League, Dress for Success, and the Glide Project. I am also a recipient of the President's Volunteer Service Award.
