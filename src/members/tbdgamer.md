I'm Terry, I've been a professional developer for over 20 years and love what I do. I stream to be able to share my experience, thoughts and opinions on software development. I love actively engaging with chat on all subjects and am happily "squirelled". 

On stream, we've developed my channel bot from scratch, worked on a project together, and more recently we've been working on a project for tracking my games collection using Xamarin Forms, Auth0 and ASP.NET Core Web API. I'm always open to new technologies, and love learning. 

Throughout the course of the stream, we'll divert to discussion, exploration and share the journey together.
