Dan is a Microsoft MVP, long time OSS maintainer, consultant and founder of the Xamarin Developer Summit #XamDevSummit. A passion for innovation and problem solving leads him to deliver leading solutions including the Prism Library and Mobile.BuildTools.

A long time tech junkie, Dan has a firm belief that you should never stop learning and always be humble enough to remember you will never know everything. He has worked with clients small and large always driving innovation and helping transform developers into constant learners. When he's not busy coding you can find him somewhere in nature, scuba diving, hiking, generally anywhere cell phones stop working.
