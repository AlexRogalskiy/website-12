Hi. My name is Trevor Wessel but people call me Stuyk (Stuck). I'm currently a Blockchain Engineer for a next generation game distribution platform working on creating tradeable digital games. My streams mostly consist of working with GTA:V and writing custom servers using the client called [alt:V](https://www.altv.mp).

I'm an entirely self-taught programmer and have written quite a few repositories.
