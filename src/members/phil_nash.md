Hi, I'm Phil Nash and I am a developer evangelist for [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) and [Google Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-phil_nash).

On stream I work on various open source projects, from the [Twilio Serverless Toolkit](https://github.com/twilio-labs/serverless-toolkit) to a [video collaboration app](https://github.com/philnash/phism) and other projects along the way. I mostly write JavaScript, occasionally throwing some Ruby into the mix, depending on what needs doing.

I love sharing what I've learned as a developer, through talks and blog posts. With Twitch I get to share it live as I discover it and it's wonderful when there are others along for the ride.
