Hey! My name is Tae'lur Alexis (or Cyber Barbie on Twitch). I am a Software Developer, Speaker, and Independent Content Creator with a passion for making learning how to code accessible for everyone.

By day, I work as a freelance front-end developer mainly focused on building accessible user interfaces with React. On the side, I've been growing a passion for learning Python so I can get into hardware programming and explore! 

I joined Twitch because I wanted to make studying a fun, relatable and interactive learning experience. Being transparent about my experiences studying programming languages live is so fun- from the compilation errors, the "aha" moments when a new concept finally clicks and being able to get live feedback is what keeps me coming back every day.

Currently on Twitch we're going through Codecademy's Computer Science course where we learn Python fundamentals, data structures and algorithms and build projects and solve quizzes together along the way. 

I also maintain an active blog where you'll find me writing beginner-friendly tutorials on JavaScript as well as posts about my coding journey complete with resources and advice!
