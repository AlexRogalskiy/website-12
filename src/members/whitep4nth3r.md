I'm Salma, an ex-music teacher and a Lead Engineer specialising in front end development.

I wrote my first programme on a Commodore64 at age 6. I built my first website at age 13 at the dawn of the home internet connection. I always wanted to be a software engineer.

However, during my teenage years, there were very few resources to learn from, even fewer role models to share my aspirations with, and even fewer ways to engage with people to guide me.

I was fortunate to be able to change my career path from music teaching to software engineering - and I've never looked back. But I can't help wondering where I might be if I'd had opportunities, support and guidance from the tech industry when I was younger.

And because of this, I firmly believe that anyone from anywhere should have access to the support, guidance and inspiration that I so deeply desired when I was younger.

I'm coding live, I'm building a community, and I'm offering a platform to build confidence, share ideas, and most importantly - learn.

## You can do anything.
