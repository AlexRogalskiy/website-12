QualityCoder has been playing with programming for as long as he can remember. He fondly recalls sitting at the family computer (a Kaypro 16 II), playing around with GW Basic and MS DOS. Later in life, he went to college for Programming, and graduated top of his class Magna Cum Laude. During his last semester in college, he interned at the local electric company, using C#. His first position after that was working for a local marketing company, programming websites using ColdFusion. His next position introduced him to PHP, and the rest, as they say, is history. Over 13 years later, he is still in love with the PHP language, the Laravel PHP framework, and Object-Oriented Programming. He has recently (1 year) gotten into Python programming, and is having fun with that.
